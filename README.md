## Abstract
Long-term traffic prediction is required to help traffic operators and travelers make decisions to prepare for future traffic congestion. However, most existing studies have only focused on short-term predictions, and there is a lack of long-term traffic prediction research. Moreover, since few methods utilize external data other than historical traffic data, the prediction accuracy of future traffic conditions, which are spatiotemporally influenced by various factors, is limited. In this paper, we aim to improve prediction accuracy by incorporating external data, especially online search log data, into conventional long-term traffic prediction methods. First, we introduce a Search Count Algorithm to transform online search logs into spatio-temporal numerical data that can be used for traffic prediction. Subsequently, we build a Spatial Temporal Embedded Encoder-Decoder with Search (STE-ED-S) to capture the spatio-temporal dependencies of historical traffic data and online search logs. Experiments using real-world expressway datasets have verified that when using online search logs, the long-term traffic prediction accuracy is improved compared to conventional methods, demonstrating the usefulness of online search log data in future prediction.
